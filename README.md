Need grunt for building project, install with :
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

After cloning, `npm install` modules in root directory.

Local testing : `grunt serve` 
Project Building : `grunt build`

After build, the dist folder can be put on the server and run with `NODE_ENV='production' node server/app.js`
